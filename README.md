# CVPacman
This is a variation of Pacman that uses computer vision to track movements of a small green object and uses it for the game input. My partner Adit Hasan and I used the open source computer vision library OpenCV for the feature detection and a lot of the code for the game itself have been sourced from the Pygame documentation site which was adapted by us.

Python3 and OpenCV and pygame are the major non-standard libraries used.


We did this as a project for my tangible computing course at the University of Alberta. My partner Adit Hasan helped me with the computer vision aspect while I focused on the game mechanics.
